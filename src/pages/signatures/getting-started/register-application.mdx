## Setting up a test application

To start using the GraphQL examples shown here in our documentation you will need to register a test application to get a set of client credentials.

A signatures application can be registed by:

1. Going to [Criipto Verify](https://dashboard.criipto.com/applications/add?tags=signatures)
2. Selecting the "Test" environment
3. Navigating to "Applications"
4. Click the button "+ Signatures"
5. Filling out the form and clicking submit

After creating the application your client credentials should be shown in a popup.

Please store the credentials in a safe location. You can refresh or delete client credentials at any time.

## Production

You can follow the same steps as in test, after you have purchased a signatures subscription (either with a creditcard or by contacting our sales team).
