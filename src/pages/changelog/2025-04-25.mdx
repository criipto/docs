## Swedish FrejaID

Authentication via Criipto Verify now supports [Swedish FrejaID](https://org.frejaeid.com/en/freja-eid-corporate/).
With FrejaID, you can authenticate users in Sweden even if they do not have a Swedish personal identity number.
This unlocks government-approved electronic ID for historically under-served segments of the population such as recent immigrants.

If you are interested in testing it out for yourself, [read our documentation on FrejaID](/verify/e-ids/frejaid) to get started.
