title: Introducing changeSignatureOrder mutation
---

## New `changeSignatureOrder` mutation

We have introduced a new mutation that enables changing a signature order after creation.
Initially it supports changing maxSignatories until the first signatory has signed.
Please reach out if you have other needs for modifying signature orders post creation.

[An example](/signatures/graphql/examples/#changing-signature-order) can be found in the Signatures documentation.

The mutation is supported in [.NET](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Criipto.Signatures) and [Node.JS](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@criipto/signatures) SDK v1.21.0.
