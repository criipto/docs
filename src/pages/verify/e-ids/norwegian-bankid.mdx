<NorwegianBankIdJwtSnippet />

The `uniqueUserId` identifies the legal person corresponding to the login, and is not considered sensitive.

### Biometric authenticator (BankID app)

<Highlight icon="info">

The level of assurance for this authenticator is: Substantial

Note that there is no `certsubject` returned when using Biometrics.

## Test users

Two types of Norwegian BankID are available:

1. _Web based BankID with a hardware token_. Also called _Netcentric_ accounts, test users from this type of BankID may be created and used on the fly.
2. _Mobile BankID_. Norwegian mobile BankID is based on a so-called _SIM card application_ which means you need a special SIM card issued by one of the Norwegian carriers.

### Creating netcentric test users

Test users are created through the web page at [https://ra-preprod.bankidnorge.no/#/search/endUser](https://ra-preprod.bankidnorge.no/#/search/endUser).

1. Go to the ["TEST NUMBER GENERATOR"](https://ra-preprod.bankidnorge.no/#/generate) to generate a random, valid SSN
2. It now says "Could not find any bankIDs for ..."
3. Fill out the first name, last name, and BankID friendly name
4. Click "Order" to initiate the process
5. Click the pencil icon and add a phone number and an email that you want to associate with the test user  
_You can use any values that match the correct email and phone number formats (note that the number of digits will differ per country). Random values are acceptable as you'll be able to access the one-time codes via URLs, as shown in steps 5 and 11 of the [Testing BankID Biometric section](/verify/e-ids/norwegian-bankid/#testing-bankid-biometric)._
6. Once the process is complete, you will have a test user. User name is the generated SSN, one time password (OTP) is always "otp", and password is always "qwer1234"

<Highlight icon="info">

It can take up to 1 hour before a newly created test user is activated.

</Highlight>

You can test it out at [our authentication demo site](https://verify-login.azurewebsites.net), which is a small sample hosted by Criipto.

### Renewing netcentric test users

If you run into issues with test users created earlier (e.g. errors when entering the one time password), your test user certificate might have expired.

![BankID test user error](./images/no-bank-id-error.png)

This can be fixed by ordering a new netcentric BankID:

- Find your test user by entering its Personal ID Number number at [https://ra-preprod.bankidnorge.no/#/search/endUser](https://ra-preprod.bankidnorge.no/#/search/endUser)
- Fill in the form to order the new netcentric BankID, choosing BankID TestBank in HA Services, and click "Order"

![Order new BankID](./images/no-bank-id-order-new-bankid.png)

### Testing BankID Biometric

Start by creating a netcentric test user as described [above](/verify/e-ids/norwegian-bankid/#creating-netcentric-test-users).

You will then need to install the test version of the BankID App. Contact our [support team](mailto:support@criipto.com) to get access to the `iOS` (distributed via `TestFlight`) or `Android` version of the test app. In your request, please provide the email address linked to your Apple ID (for `iOS`) or your Google account for the Play Store (for `Android`) used for testing. Our team will get back to you with confirmation and download links for the test app.

The app must be activated before first use:

1. Press the **Activate BankID app** button
2. Press the **Activate** button
3. Enter the birth number (SSN) for the test user you created and press the **Next** button
4. Enter the phone number you associated to the test user and press the **Next** button
5. Open the following page to get your your SMS one-time code (after replacing the `{yourTestSsn}` placeholder with your actual test-SSN): https://toba-preprod.bankidapis.no/test-events/sms-sent-to-qualified-user/{yourTestSsn}  
_Note: The page might need to be refreshed several times, and if multiple activations are done in a short period, old SMS codes may be shown. Only the newest activation code will at any point be valid_
6. Type the one-time code that is shown on the website into the app and press the **Next** button
7. Select **Alternative activation** in the next page
8. Press the **Get activation codes** button
9. Proceed past the information pages that explain **What you need** and the **Steps to activate** with the chosen method
10. Press the **Send email** button in the "Is this your email?” screen
11. Open the following page to get your email activation codes (once again, replace the {yourTestSsn} placeholder with your test-SSN) https://ra-preprod.bankidnorge.no/notification-console/content/{yourTestSsn}
12. Type the code words that are shown on the website into the app and press the **Next** button
13. Press the **Next** button in the "Log in using BankID to complete the activation” screen
14. Wait until BankID client has loaded in the browser. Pick **BankID app** in the method list if it is not already preselected.
15. Type "qwer1234” as personal password and click the blue arrow button to the right
16. A progress bar will appear and when finished you will be activated
17. Enable biometrics (which will take you through a flow where you must agree to the terms and conditions)
18. Run your first biometrics-based login

### Testing Mobile BankID

For testing you may order up to three test SIM cards through Criipto once you have signed up for Norwegian BankID.

## Data and consent for Norwegian BankID

### Available data / scopes

Basic user information, full name, and date of birth are always made available. Additional data may be requested and is released with explicit user consent only.

For applications configured to use a `dynamic` `scope` strategy, the following `scope` tokens can be supplied: `address`, `email`, `phone` and `ssn`.

| **Data type**                      | **Released**      | **Verified** | **scope** | **login_hint**  |
| ---------------------------------- | ----------------- | ------------ | --------- | --------------- |
| Full name                          | Always            | Yes          |           |                 |
| Date of birth                      | Always            | Yes          |           |                 |
| SSN ("fødselsnummer" in Norwegian) | User consent      | Yes          | `ssn`     | `scope:ssn`     |
| Address                            | With user consent | No           | `address` | `scope:address` |
| Email                              | With user consent | No           | `email`   | `scope:email`   |
| Phone number                       | With user consent | No           | `phone`   | `scope:phone`   |

#### Example (partial) authorize request with scopes
```
https://YOUR_SUBDOMAIN.criipto.id/oauth2/authorize?scope=openid email address&...
```
Alternatively, you can send them in the `login_hint`
```
https://YOUR_SUBDOMAIN.criipto.id/oauth2/authorize?...&login_hint=scope:email scope:address&...
```
which can be a useful if you are working with technology that does not let you control the `scope` value.

Access to the SSN is governed by Norwegian law, as described in the [Ordering Norwegian BankID](/eid-specifics/order-no-bankid) guide.

The unverified data are supplied by end-users and not verified by Bidbax (operator of BankID) or the Norwegian banks.

### Consent model

End-users must explicitly grant consent to releasing the data to you.

The consent model is enforced by Bidbax, and they also provide the consent and data collection dialogs.

### Forced and optional consent

If you request SSN, it will be treated as a required value. End users will not be allowed to complete a login until they have explicitly given their consent to release SSN.

All other additional data are treated as optional values. A login may complete even if the user does not consent to release the requested data.

Consent to SSN will be stored by Criipto for 1 year for your tenant, after which the user must provide explicit SSN consent again.

<Highlight icon="info">

Criipto _does not_ store the SSN itself, just the fact that the user has granted your tenant access to it.

</Highlight>

<ConsentRevocation />

### Configuration

You can use the Criipto management dashboard [dashboard.criipto.com](https://dashboard.criipto.com/providers/NO_BANKID) to configure access to the optional user data, in the **Identity Sources** -> **NO BankID** section.

## Ordering Norwegian BankID

To start accepting real users with Norwegian BankID, you must first request your _client credentials_ from Bidbax. The credentials consists of a _client id_ and a _client secret_.

<Highlight icon="file-lines">

**Prerequisites for ordering**

In order to apply for the BankID client credentials for a company you must meet the basic requirements:

- Your company must be a customer of a Norwegian Bank. Most banks in Norway are part of the BankID network.
- The person that will sign the contract must be in possession of one of these personal eIDs: Norwegian BankID, Swedish BankID, or Danish MitID.
- You must have completed step 5 in the [Getting ready for production](/verify/guides/production) guide. You will need the production domain to complete the order for your client credentials.

</Highlight>

### New customers

The BankID OIDC Biometrics option is now available when ordering BankID.

Biometrics is always included in the basis agreement.

### Existing customers

Due to new terms and conditions in the agreement, you must send us an updated application if you wish to use BankID Biometrics.

### BankID Biometrics assurance level

BankID Biometrics assurance level is “Substantial”.

[Learn more about assurance levels](https://ec.europa.eu/digital-building-blocks/wikis/display/DIGITAL/eIDAS+Levels+of+Assurance).

If you can only use assurance level “High” in your login flow, you must explicitly specify the [login_hint=BID](/verify/guides/prefilled-fields/) in your authorize requests to Criipto Verify. _Please note that using `login_hint=BID` will disable biometrics in the BankID app._  

### Modifying user flows

By default, the user flow is controlled by the user-defined settings of the BankID app: no additional configurations required. If necessary, you can adjust the user flow by adding a `login_hint` to the [authorize URL](/verify/guides/authorize-url-builder/).

The table below provides a list of options for using `login_hint` with Norwegian BankID, and the resulting user flows. Check [our guide on prefilled fields](https://docs.criipto.com/verify/guides/prefilled-fields/) to learn more.

| Parameter                                                           | Description |
|---------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------|
| `login_hint=BID`                                                    | The user will be redirected to the BankID app, with biometrics disabled. The user will be queried for userID(i.e. national identity number) in the first dialogue. |
| `login_hint=BID:<SSN>`, where `<SSN>` has the format `DDMMYYXXXXX`  | The user will be redirected to the BankID app (with biometrics disabled) along with a pre-selected userID. The userID dialogue is omitted in this case.          |
| `login_hint=BIS`                                                    | The user will be redirected to the BankID app. The user will be queried for userID in the first dialogue. This option does not disable biometrics.               |
| `login_hint=BIS:<SSN>`, where `<SSN>` has the format `DDMMYYXXXXX`  | The user will be redirected to the BankID app with a pre-selected userID. This option does not disable biometrics.                                                            |
| no `login_hint` provided                                            | The default settings of the BankID app on the user's device will determine the flow (whether biometrics are enabled or disabled).                                       |

### Next steps

After Criipto has received the above information, we order the client credntials from your bank by filling out an online agreement, which is then sent to the appointed persons at your company for signing. Criipto will also sign the agreement

When all signatures are in place the signed agreement is sent to your bank for further processing and eventual issuance of your client credentials.

Once you have received credentials, they must be entered into the Criipto Verify management UI to configure your NO BankID integration.
