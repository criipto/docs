import Layout from '../../../layouts/mdx';

export default Layout;

## Setting up your tenant

If you don't already have your own Criipto tenant,
[go ahead and create one](https://docs.criipto.com/verify/getting-started/basics/#tenants) -
it's free while you're testing.

### Pick an environment

Pick the environment you want to implement. If you are just beginning, we recommend the test environment
(this is also the only one available before you purchase a subscription).

In test, some eIDs will let you define the birthdate when creating new test users,
which will let you test interactions with underage (or of-age) users.

### Setup application

Setup a [domain and application](/verify/getting-started/basics/#domains).

For "Callback URLs" you should add the URL of your own system.
If the exact paths in your own system are yet unknown,
you can use `https://jwt.io/` while testing.

### Enable the age verification extension

*If you do not see the "Extensions" tab in your main navigation, please contact Criipto*

1. Click on the "Extensions" tab
2. Select "Catalogue"
3. Find the "Age verification" extension
4. Install it

## Integration

### Parameters

Integrating age verification is done via our [standard OpenID Connect offering](/verify/getting-started/oidc-intro/)
with the follow specifics:

- `acr_values=urn:age-verification`
- `login_hint=country:{country}`, `{country}` can be one of DK|SE|NO|FI
- `scope=openid is_over_18`, values such as `is_over_16` and `is_over_21` are also supported, see extension documentation for full list.

### Example JWT

import JwtSnippet from '../../../snippets/jwt-payloads/age-verification';

<JwtSnippet />

*Be aware that the `sub` field is random for each login and cannot be used to correlate the user*

## Authorize URL Builder

import AuthorizeURLBuilder from '../../../components/AuthorizeURLBuilder';

<AuthorizeURLBuilder
  acr_values={["urn:age-verification"]}
  login_hint="country:DK"
  scope={['openid', 'is_over_18']}
  quirks={false}
/>
