## JWT/Token example

verified, with national number, personal info, photo and address enabled

<BelgianEidJwtSnippet />

## Test users

This login method is smartcard based, so you will need both a smartcard reader and accompanying cards.

For test domains, you can use both test-specific cards and also "live" cards. The only difference is that on test domains, the data from the card will not be verified after being read.

For production domains, you cannot use test cards, as the data on these cannot be verified.
