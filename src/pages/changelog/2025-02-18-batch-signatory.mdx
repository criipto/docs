title: Introducing batch signatory for signatures
---

As a step towards enabling interacting with large batches of signature orders, we have introduced a feature for batching signatories across one of more signature orders.
A batch signatory can then be used to invoke a single action and have it performed automatically across every signatory.

As batch signatories can be used to sign multiple, different signature orders at once, some requirements exist.
A more detailed explanation, and interactive tour, can be found at the [batch signatory guide page](https://docs.criipto.com/signatures/guides/batch-signatory/).
