**Signatory roles** are used to designate what actions a given signatory is allowed to perform.
A signatory's role can be set when adding a signatory to a signature order.

Signatory roles aim to cover complex signing scenarios, such as, requiring approval before a signature order can be closed/signed **or** allowing certain people to access to the signature order thoughout its lifetime.

## Viewer Signatory

A viewer signatory can be used to grant access to the signature order documents, either all or a subset, without requiring any special action, i.e., signing.

### Evidence Validation

A viewer signatory can only view the documents when the signature order is open unless evidence validation is defined.
The evidence validation is used to secure the signatory's access to the completed document(s) after closing, if retention is specified.
If no evidence validation is specified, the viewer can only access the document(s) when the signature order is open.

## Approver Signatory

An approver signatory can be used to require that the signature order documents, either all or a subset, are approved, but not signed, before the signature order can be closed.

In addition to requiring an approval before closing, the role can be combined with [Signing Sequence](/signatures/graphql/examples/#signing-sequence) to require that the given document(s) have been approved before it can be signed.

NB: When specifying a signatory as an approver, the document(s) cannot be marked as pre-approved.

### Evidence Validation

An approver signatory can only view the documents when the signature order is open unless evidence validation is defined.
The evidence validation is used to secure the signatory's access to the completed document(s) after closing, if retention is specified.
If no evidence validation is specified, the approver can only access the document(s) when the signature order is open.

## Signer Signatory (default)

Requires the signatory to both approve and sign the signature order documents, either all or a subset, before the signature order can be closed.
