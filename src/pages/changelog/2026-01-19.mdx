## Removal of PDF bookmarks

When combining multiple PDF documents in Adobe, a default enabled option creates bookmarks for each of the combined PDFs.
Attempting to sign such a combined document likely renders the signatures invalid as Adobe believes the document to have been altered.

We have extended the `PadesDocumentInput`, when creating a signature order, with a property `removeBookmarks`.
Bookmarks will be removed from the signed document(s) where the flag is set.

To better support flexible flows, e.g., let the end user decide, the `validateDocument` mutation returns whether the provided document contains any bookmarks.

Drawback is that users that previously relied on the bookmarks for navigation will no longer have the option, however, signatures are now correctly shown as valid.

Please note: bookmarks generated from headings in Word or Google Docs don't suffer the same issue, it's only _after_ such PDFs have been combined the issue occurs.
