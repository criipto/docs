title: Introducing Personalausweis and batch signatories
---

## German Personalausweis

Authentication via Criipto Verify now supports the German national identity card Personalausweis.
This means that you can now electronically authenticate users in Germany quickly and easily.

You can [read more about the Personalausweis](https://www.personalausweisportal.de/Webs/PA/EN/home/home-node.html) on the German government Personalausweis portal.
If you are interested in testing it out for yourself, [read our documentation on Personalausweis](/verify/e-ids/german-personalausweis) to get started.

## Batch signatories for signatures

As a step towards enabling interacting with large batches of signature orders, we have introduced a feature for batching signatories across one of more signature orders.
A batch signatory can then be used to invoke a single action and have it performed automatically across every signatory.

As batch signatories can be used to sign multiple, different signature orders at once, some requirements exist.
A more detailed explanation, and interactive tour, can be found at the [batch signatory guide page](https://docs.criipto.com/signatures/guides/batch-signatory/).
