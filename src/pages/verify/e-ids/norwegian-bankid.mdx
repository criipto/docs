### Kodebrikke and Mobile authenticators

<Highlight icon="info">

The level of assurance for these authenticators are: High

</Highlight>

    }
  }

The `uniqueUserId` identifies the legal person corresponding to the login, and is not considered sensitive.

### Biometric authenticator (BankID app)

<Highlight icon="info">

The level of assurance for this authenticator is: Substantial

Note that there is no `certsubject` returned when using Biometrics.

## Test users

Two types of Norwegian BankID are available:

1. _Web based BankID with a hardware token_. Also called _Netcentric_ accounts, test users from this type of BankID may be created and used on the fly.
2. _Mobile BankID_. Norwegian mobile BankID is based on a so-called _SIM card application_ which means you need a special SIM card issued by one of the Norwegian carriers.

### Creating netcentric test users

Test users are created through the web page at [https://ra-preprod.bankidnorge.no/#/search/endUser](https://ra-preprod.bankidnorge.no/#/search/endUser).

1. Go to the "TEST NUMBER GENERATOR" to generate a random, valid SSN
2. It now says "Could not find any bankIDs for ..."
3. Fill out the first name, last name, and BankID friendly name
4. Click "Order" to initiate the process
5. Once the process is complete, you will have a test user. User name is the generated SSN, one time password (OTP) is always "otp", and password is always "qwer1234"

<Highlight icon="info">

It can take up to 1 hour before a newly created test user is activated.

</Highlight>

You can test it out at [our authentication demo site](https://verify-login.azurewebsites.net), which is a small sample hosted by Criipto.

### Testing BankID Biometric
Start by creating a netcentric test user as described above, and add an email and a phone number to the user.

You will then need to install the test version of the BankID App. To get access to the `iOS` or `Android` version of the test app, please contact our support team. (On `iOS`, the test version is distributed via `TestFlight`).

The app must be activated before first use:

1. Press the Get started button
2. Press the Activate BankID App button
3. Press Continue
4. Enter the birth number (SSN) for the test user you created and press the Next button
5. Press the Get activation codes button
6. Press the Next button
7. Enter the phone number you associated to the test user and press the Next button
8. Open the following page to get your activation codes (after replacing the `{yourTestSsn}` placeholder with your actual test-SSN): https://ra-preprod.bankidnorge.no/notification-console/content/{yourTestSsn}
9. Type the one-time code that is shown on the website into the app and press the Next button
10. Press the Next button in the "Is this your email?” screen
11. Type the code words that are shown on the website into the app and press the Next button
12. Press the Next button in the "Log in using BankID to complete the activation” screen
13. Wait until BankID client has loaded in the browser. Pick BankID app in the method list if it is not already preselected.
14. Type "qwer1234” as personal password and click the blue arrow button to the right
15. A progress bar will appear and when finished you will be activated
16. Enable biometrics (which will take you through a flow where you must agree to the terms and conditions).
17. Run your first biometrics-based login.

### Testing Mobile BankID

For testing you may order up to three test SIM cards through Criipto once you have signed up for Norwegian BankID.

## Data and consent for Norwegian BankID

### Available data / scopes
Basic user information, full name, and date of birth are always made available. Additional data may be requested and is released with explicit user consent only.

For applications configured to use a `dynamic` `scope` strategy, the following `scope` tokens can be supplied: `address`, `email`, `phone` and `ssn`.

| **Data type** | **Released** | **Verified** | **scope** | **login_hint**
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Full name | Always | Yes | | |
| Date of birth | Always | Yes | | |
| SSN ("fødselsnummer" in Norwegian) | User consent | Yes | `ssn` | `scope:ssn` |
| Address | With user consent | No | `address` | `scope:address` |
| Email | With user consent | No | `email` | `scope:email` |
| Phone number | With user consent | No | `phone` | `scope:phone` |

#### Example (partial) authorize request with scopes
```
https://YOUR_SUBDOMAIN.criipto.id/oauth2/authorize?scope=openid email address&...
```
Alternatively, you can send them in the `login_hint`
```
https://YOUR_SUBDOMAIN.criipto.id/oauth2/authorize?...&login_hint=scope:email scope:address&...
```
which can be a useful if you are working with technology that does not let you control the `scope` value.

Access to the SSN is governed by Norwegian law, as described in the [Ordering Norwegian BankID](/eid-specifics/order-no-bankid) guide.

The unverified data are supplied by end-users and not verified by Bidbax (operator of BankID) or the Norwegian banks.

### Consent model

End-users must explicitly grant consent to releasing the data to you.

The consent model is enforced by Bidbax, and they also provide the consent and data collection dialogs.

### Forced and optional consent

If you request SSN, it will be treated as a required value. End users will not be allowed to complete a login until they have explicitly given their consent to release SSN.

All other additional data are treated as optional values. A login may complete even if the user does not consent to release the requested data.

Consent to SSN will be stored by Criipto for 1 year for your tenant, after which the user must provide explicit SSN consent again.

<Highlight icon="info">

Criipto _does not_ store the SSN itself, just the fact that the user has granted your tenant access to it.

</Highlight>

<ConsentRevocation />

### Configuration

You can use the Criipto management dashboard [dashboard.criipto.com](https://dashboard.criipto.com/providers/NO_BANKID) to configure access to the optional user data, in the **Identity Sources** -> **NO BankID** section.

## Ordering Norwegian BankID

To start accepting real users with Norwegian BankID, you must first request your _client credentials_ from Bidbax. The credentials consists of a _client id_ and a _client secret_.

<Highlight icon="file-lines">

**Prerequisites for ordering**

In order to apply for the BankID client credentials for a company you must meet the basic requirements:

- Your company must be a customer of a Norwegian Bank. Most banks in Norway are part of the BankID network.
- The person that will sign the contract must be in possession of one of these personal eIDs: Norwegian BankID, Swedish BankID, or Danish NemID
- You must have completed step 5 in the [Getting ready for production](/verify/guides/production) guide. You will need the production domain to complete the order for your client credentials.

</Highlight>

### New customers

The BankID OIDC Biometrics option is now available when ordering BankID.

Biometrics is always included in the basis agreement.

### Existing customers

Due to new terms and conditions in the agreement, you must send us an updated application if you wish to use BankID Biometrics.

### About BankID Biometrics

BankID Biometrics assurance level is “Substantial”.

If you can only use assurance level “High” in your login flow, you must explicitly specify the [login_hint=BID](/verify/guides/prefilled-fields/) in your authorize requests to Criipto Verify, as described in [our guide on prefilled fields](https://docs.criipto.com/verify/guides/prefilled-fields/)

### Next steps

After Criipto has received the above information, we order the client credntials from your bank by filling out an online agreement, which is then sent to the appointed persons at your company for signing. Criipto will also sign the agreement

When all signatures are in place the signed agreement is sent to your bank for further processing and eventual issuance of your client credentials.

Once you have received credentials, they must be entered into the Criipto Verify management UI to configure your NO BankID integration.
