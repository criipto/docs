## AWS Cognito basics

Your AWS Cognito user pool must be configured **without** email as an required attribute.

Make sure you have configured a Amazon Cognito domain for your AWS Cognito user pool (in this example we have picked `https://criipto-samples.auth.us-east-1.amazoncognito.com`)

## Register your Criipto Application

1. Login to you Criipto Verify account - [https://dashboard.criipto.com/applications/add](https://dashboard.criipto.com/applications/add)
2. Navigate to Applications
3. Click the "Add login application" button
4. Enter application name (in this example we used "AWS Cognito" and select a domain)
5. Register the callback URL for your AWS Cognito Domain (`https://<your-user-pool-domain>/oauth2/idpresponse`)
6. Enable OAuth2 Code Flow
7. Create application and make a note of your client id and client secret
8. Modify your "User info response strategy" to "plainJson" and save your application.

## Perform a login

Launch the hosted UI for your AWS Cognito domain/client or perform an authorize request.
