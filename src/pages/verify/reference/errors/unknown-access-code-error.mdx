title: Unknown Access Code error
errors: verify

The `Unknown Access Code` error can happen when trying to fetch information from the `userinfo` endpoint for one of two reasons:

1. You are reusing a code (authorization codes can only be used once for a [code exchange](/verify/reference/glossary/#code-exchange)).
2. Your application OIDC setting `User info response strategy` is set to `fromTokenEndpoint`.

If you encounter this error in production but it worked in test, make sure that your production application and test application have the exact same OIDC settings.

You can **Copy application** from Test to Production to ensure the settings are identical.
