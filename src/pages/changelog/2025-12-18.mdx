## EUTL for Signatures

The Idura Signatures product will move from AATL to EUTL certificates and timestamping on January 8th, 2026.

This has no negative effects\*, but has the positive effect that signed documents can now be validated in both Adobe and the EU DSS validator.

_\* Users with very old versions of Adobe Reader will have to update their EUTL trust list in the Adobe Reader Trust Manager._
