Once you have developed and tested your application to work with test user accounts, you are ready to move ahead and work with real user eID accounts.

_Please note_ that for production usage, you do need a paid subscription.

Follow these steps to get ready for production:

1. If you haven't done so already, go to the [subscription management site](https://subscription.criipto.com) and choose a plan that suits your expected usage.
2. Next, you must acquire a production certificate for the eID provider(s) you wish to use in production. More on how to do that [can be found here](/verify/e-ids).
3. Go to [dashboard.criipto.com](https://dashboard.criipto.com) and log in to access your tenant
4. Make sure the Production/Test toggle at the top center is set to "PRODUCTION".
5. Go to the "Domains" tab and set up a production domain.
    - Note that if you choose a domain that ends with something other than `criipto.id`, we recommend going with the Criipto managed option ("Managed SSL certificate") for SSL certificate.
6. Go to the "Applications" tab and register your production application:
    - The Client ID must be unique; it cannot be the same as any of your other applications
7. Configure your production application with the new domain, Client ID, and Client secret. 

Once you have been through these steps, you are ready to start using real Swedish BankID, Danish NemID, and others in your production application.
