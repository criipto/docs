## Why are users asked for their CPR during MitID Erhverv login?

This allows to look up [company signatories](/verify/e-ids/danish-mitid-erhverv/#employees-and-company-signatories) from the business registry, in case the user has a company that is not registered with MitID Erhverv.
If you don't need this feature, you can turn it off. Go to your Idura Dashboard and **Disable signatories for MitID business logins** under **eID Providers** > **Danish MitID**.
