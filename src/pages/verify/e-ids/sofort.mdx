## Test users

3 pre-created test accounts exist - 1 can be used for a succesful login, the other 2 will return errors.

You will be prompted for an `account number` and a `PIN` during login. You can use pretty much any values you like, as long as you specify 4 characters for the `account number` and 3 characters for the `PIN`.

| **Test account** | **Valid** | **Account Number** | **PIN** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Hans-Gerd Warnecke | yes | 4+ characters | 3+ characters |
| Petra Mustermann | no | 4+ characters | 3+ characters |
| Max Mustermann | no | 4+ characters | 3+ characters |

Full account details are available [in the Sofort documentation](https://integration.sofort.com/integrationCenter-eng-DE/content/view/full/2867/#h5)
