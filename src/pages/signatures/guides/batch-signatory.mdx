import GraphQLExample from '../../../components/GraphQLExample';

**Batch Signatory** is a concept for bundling multiple signatories.
Previously, it was only possible for each signatory to sign PDF documents individually.
With a batch signatory, one can perform batch operations in a single call, acting on behalf of several signatories. This helps avoid repeated authentications or rejections.

A batch signatory can be created by providing a list of signature order ID + signatory ID pairs.

Each signature order and signatory **must share** at least one evidence provider.
This is required to be able to invoke a single authentication and have it signed on every document in the batch.

## Creating a batch signatory

import createExample from '../../../examples/createBatchSignatory/basic'

A batch signatory requires a list of previously created signature orders and signatories.

Each signatory pair needs to be valid, i.e., the signatory needs to be from the signature order **and** every signatory needs to share at least one evidence provider.
Batch signatories are validated upon creation to ensure valid state.

A more specialized case is having more signatories for the same signature order in the same batch.

The batch signatory can then view, approve and sign or reject as usual via the normal flow.

### UI settings

import uiExample from '../../../examples/createBatchSignatory/ui'

As with signature orders and signatories, it is possible to define UI settings for batch signatories.
The UI settings are defined for the batch, which means that settings defined for signature orders and signatories won't be considered.
