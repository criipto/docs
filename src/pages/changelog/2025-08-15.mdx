title: Introducing custom seals page template feature
---

## Custom seals page template

We added [custom seals page template](/signatures/graphql/examples/#custom-seals-page-template) to the Signatures API. The new add-on feature gives you full control over the signature seals page.
Instead of the default blank page, you can now provide your own branded PDF template, making it easy to add your company's logo and colors to the signed document.

Walk through an [interactive tour](/signatures/guides/custom-seals-page-template/#interactive-tour) to see it in action.
