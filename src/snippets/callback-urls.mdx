Before you can start sending authentication requests to Criipto Verify you need to register the URLs on which you want to receive the returned _JSON Web Token_, JWT.

The Callback URL of your application is the URL where Criipto Verify will redirect to after the user has authenticated in order for the OpenID Connect ASP.NET middleware to complete the authentication process.

You will need to add this URL to the list of allowed URLs for your application. The Callback URL for the sample project project is https://localhost:5001/callback and http://localhost:5000/callback, so be sure to add this to the Callback URLs section of your application. Put each URL on a new line.

If you deploy your application to a different URL you will also need to ensure to add that URL to the Callback URLs.
