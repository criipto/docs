title: Stronger accessibility requirements for Swedish BankID
---

From July 2025, stronger requirements regarding accessibility must be fulfilled to meet legal demands.
Amongst other things, these will affect the two-device flow for BankID where the animated QR code is used.

In order to comply with the new QR code UI requirements Criipto must make adjustments to its UI (HTML & CSS),
so that users may click the QR code to view it in fullscreen.

This can cause breaking changes to customers who have custom CSS, so customers must explicitely opt-in to the UI update.

You can opt-in to the UI update for the test environment, and even per application, before doing so in production.

To opt-in at a tenant environment level:
1. [Open dashboard](https://dashboard.criipto.com)
2. [Navigate to Styling screen](https://dashboard.criipto.com/styling)
3. Select 2025-04-01 in the "View version" dropdown
4. Click save

To opt-in at an application level:
1. [Open dashboard](https://dashboard.criipto.com)
2. [Navigate to Applications screen](https://dashboard.criipto.com/applications)
3. Select the application you wish to upgrade
4. Click the "UI" tab
5. Disable "Use default" for the "View version" option
6. Select "2025-01-04" in the "View version" dropdown
7. Click save
