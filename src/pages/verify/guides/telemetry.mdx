Criipto offers telemetry and observability into authentication flows.

<Highlight icon="exclamation" warning>
Criipto may at any time change the contents of the traces or the formats of headers/query parameters.
</Highlight>

## Enabling telemetry

Please contact support to enable telemetry for your tenant.

## Capturing trace id

After telemetry has been enabled, a new "Telemetry" screen will be present in the dashboard.

On this screen you can enable "Augment header and protocol responses". When this setting
is enabled, Criipto will augment certain headers and protocol query responses to include trace ids.

### PAR

For "Pushed Authorize Requests" a `Trace-Id` header will be added to the response (if "Augment header and protocol responses" is enabled).

```sh
POST /oauth2/par HTTP/1.1
Host: as.example.com
Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded

response_type=code&...
```

```sh
HTTP/1.1 201 Created
Content-Type: application/json
Trace-Id: 0190163d8694739baea5966c26f8ad91

{
  "request_uri": "urn:ietf:params:oauth:request_uri:6esc_11ACC5bwc014ltc14eY22c",
