<BelgianItsmeJwtSnippet />

## Test users

You will need to enroll with the Itsme organization to get access to test accounts, which can be used in the `Itsme Sandbox` environment.

The process is [described here](https://brand.belgianmobileid.be/d/CX5YsAKEmVI7/let-s-get-started#/step-by-step-guide/4-test-itsme-in-your-application) - just note that the integration guidelines of that documentation is not relevant for you, as you are integrating via Criipto's pre-built Itsme integration. It is all just a matter of configuring your project settings in our management UI.
