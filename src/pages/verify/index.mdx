title: Use eID in your applications
---

For an introduction to Criipto Verify and eID, you may want to read [the overview](/verify/getting-started/overview) in the Getting Started section.

Criipto Verify supports two distinct use cases supported by most eID solutions:

**Authentication**

All eID services supports user authentication. With Criipto Verify you integrate using *OpenID Connect* (aka OIDC). A general introduction to OIDC with Criipto Verify is available in the section on [Using OIDC](/verify/getting-started/oidc-intro).

**Digital Signatures**

Due to the underlying use of asymmetric encryption by some eID services, like the Norwegian and Swedish BankID, 
digitally signing text is also supported through a proprietary Criipto API. 

- SE BankID: offers signing via [specific OIDC parameters](/verify/e-ids/swedish-bankid/#signing-textmarkdown)
- NO BankID: More documentation on this will soon follow, 
but we have an example of how to program both plain [text signing and PDF signing into your ASP.NET Core app](https://github.com/criipto/docs-old/blob/master/signatures/dotnet-core-v3.md#plain-text-signature)
