Some eIDs require additional configuration when configuring authentication parameters to work.

## German Personalausweis

In test environment, you will need to add `login_hint=txinfo:{sometext}` as described in [Verify German Personalausweis documentation](/verify/e-ids/german-personalausweis/#test-authorize-requests).

## Dutch iDIN

By default, Signatures provides a display name template by combining the `given_name` and `family_name` from the JWT claims.
To retrieve name information from iDIN, you will need to provide an additional scope on either signature order or sigantory level to enable [full identification](https://docs.criipto.com/verify/e-ids/dutch-idin/#full-identification).

`scope=openid idin:full-id` - `openid` is required by default, and by setting the scope, the default value is overwritten.

## FrejaID

By default, Signatures provides a display name template by combining the `given_name` and `family_name` from the JWT claims.
Name information can be retrieved from FrejaID by providing an additional [scope](/verify/e-ids/frejaid/#scopes-for-frejaid), **however**, [setting a minimum registration level](/verify/e-ids/frejaid/#setting-a-minimum-registration-level) of at least "Extended" is required.

`scope=openid freja:basic_user_info` AND `loginHint=minregistrationlevel:{extended,plus}` - `openid` is required by default, and by setting the scope, the default value is overwritten.

## Finnish Trust Network (FTN)

Recent requirement changes in Finland mean that JWTs need to be signed and encrypted.
It is therefore not possible to extract JWT claims from the `documents.signatures.jwt` field as with other eIDs or previously.

Claims are exposed as part of the `documents.signatures.claims` array of `name` and `value` pairs.
