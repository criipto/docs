title: MitID Controlled Transfer
---

Authentication via Criipto Verify now supports starting a session for MitID Controlled Transfer.

MitID Controlled Transfer lets you perform cross-broker SSO, that is, transfering an authenticated MitID user
from one service provider to another, without requiring the other service provider to reauthenticate the user.

This is useful for cases where shared data services may require a valid MitID authentication to serve data for the user,
but you do not wish to trigger authentication twice for the user.
