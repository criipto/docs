## Signatory Roles

**Signatory roles** are used to designate what actions a given signatory is allowed to perform.
A signatory's role can be set when adding a signatory to a signature order.

Signatory roles aim to cover complex signing scenarios, such as, requiring specific people approve before a signature order can be closed/signed **or** allowing certain people access to the signature order thoughout its lifetime.

Please read the more in-depth guide under [Signatures > Guides > Signatory Roles](/signatures/guides/signatory-roles/)
