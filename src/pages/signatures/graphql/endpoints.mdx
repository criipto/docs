## Query execution

GraphQL queries can be executed against `https://signatures-api.criipto.com/v1/graphql`. Queries must be sent as a `POST` request containing a `JSON` body with the parameters `query` and optionally `variables`.

```text
curl -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -u clientId:clientSecret \
  --data '{"query": "... graphql query ...", "variables": {"key": "value"}}'\ 
  https://signatures-api.criipto.com/v1/graphql
```

## Schema

If you need to fetch the schema for build/codegen tools you can do so by executing a `GET` request against `https://signatures-api.criipto.com/v1/graphql`.

```text
curl https://signatures-api.criipto.com/v1/graphql
```

## Explorer

A general purpose GraphQL Explorer is available at [GraphQL > Explorer](https://docs.criipto.com/signatures/graphql/explorer).

The explorer connects to the GraphQL endpoint, so it is always up-to-date.
