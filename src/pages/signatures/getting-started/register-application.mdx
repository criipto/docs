## Setting up a test application

To start working with the Criipto Signatures API and using the [GraphQL examples](/signatures/graphql/examples), you'll need to register a test application to obtain your client credentials (**Client ID** and **Client Secret**).

To register a new Signatures application:

1. Go to the [Criipto Dashboard](https://dashboard.criipto.com)
2. Select **Test environment** from the dropdown in the top-left corner. 
3. Navigate to **Applications** 
4. Click **Add application** and choose **Signatures**
5. Fill out and submit the application form

After creating the application, your client credentials will be shown in a popup.

Please store them in a safe location. You can refresh or delete your client credentials at any time.
