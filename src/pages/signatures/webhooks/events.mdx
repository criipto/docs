Webhooks will be executed as `POST` requests against the URL you have defined on your signature order. The URL will be used as-is, no parameters will be stripped.

The POST request will contain a `JSON` body similar to the events shown below.

You can use the values included in the webhook body to query the GraphQL API for more details.
